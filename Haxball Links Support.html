<h3>/avatar {avatartext}</h3>
<h4>Sets the player avatar text.<br></h4>

<h3>clear_avatar</h3>
<h4>Clears the player avatar text, the player text will be his number.<br></h4><br>

<h3>/colors {team} {angle} {textcolor} {color1} {color2} {color3}</h3>
<h4>Changes the colors of a team. Only admins can use this command.<br>

Colors are expressed in Hexadecimal RRGGBB, for example red is FF0000, green is 00FF00 and blue is 0000FF.<br>

Arguments:<br>

team: The team for which colors will be set. Should be either red or blue.<br>
angle: The angle for the team color stripes. In degrees.<br>
textcolor: The color of the player avatars.<br>
color1: The first color for the team.<br>
color2: The second color for the team. This is optional, if omitted the team will have only 1 color (no stripes).<br>
color3: The third color for the team. This is optional, if omitted the team will have only 2 colors.<br>
Example: /colors red 60 FFFFFF 0080FF 004077 002033<br></h4><br><br>

<h3>/colors {team} clear<br></h3>
<h4>Clears the colors of a team, resetting back to default colors. Only admins can use this command.<br></h4><br>

<h3>/checksum<br></h3>
<h4>Obtains a checksum of the current stadium, can be used to verify the loaded stadium if you know the checksum beforehand.<br></h4><br>

<h3>/store</h3>
<h4>Stores the current stadium of the room, the stadium will then appear in the stadium selection menu.<br></h4><br>

<h3>/set_password {password}<br></h3>
<h4>Sets the password for the room. Only the host can use this command.<br></h4><br>

<h3>/clear_password<br></h3>
<h4>Clears the password of the room. Only the host can use this command.<br></h4><br>

<h3>/recaptcha {on|off}<br></h3>
<h4>Activates or deactivates the recaptcha requirement to join the room. Only the host can use this command.<br></h4><br>

<h3>/clear_bans<br><h3>
<h4>Clears the banned player list. Only the host can use this command.<br></h4><br>

<h3>/handicap {milliseconds}<br></h3>
<h4>Adds a certain amount of milliseconds of lag to your client, this can be used to give yourself a disadvantage. It’s useful<br> for balancing when playing against someone with higher ping than you.<br></h4><br>

<h3>/extrapolation {milliseconds}<br></h3>
<h4>Causes the game to extrapolate by a certain amount of milliseconds. It can be used to counteract the effects of input<br> delay but at the cost of extra “warping” in the game prediction.
  It is recommended to leave this at 0 unless you have input delay.<br></h4><br>


<h3>/kick_ratelimit {min} {rate} {burst}<br></h3>
<h4>Set’s the room’s ball-kick ratelimit.<br><br>

min is the minimum number of logic-frames between two kicks. It is impossible to kick faster than this.<br>

rate works like min but lets players save up extra kicks to use them later depending on the value of burst.<br>

burst is how many extra kicks a player can save up.<br></h4><br>

<h3> example:   /kick_ratelimit</h3><h4> 2 15 3 If a player spams kick he’ll kick every 2 frames for the first 4 kicks and after that <br>he’ll be limited to one kick every 15 frames ( which is 4 kicks per second ). If the player doesn’t kick for 1 second <br>he’ll save enough for another burst of 4 kicks.<br></h4><br>

<h3>GUIDE TO CREATING T-SHIRTS </h3>
<h4>With this guide you will learn how to create a shirt for the game and also how colors work on computers.<br>

The command is: /colors (Team) (Angle) (Letter color) (Color 1) (Color 2) (Color 3)<br>

As you will see, it is very easy to understand. Haxball also offers us a page to develop it more intuitively: <u>https://haxcolors.com/</u>.<br>

There they will be able to choose the colors, the number of lines (1, 2, 3) and once they put together the shirt to their liking,<br> they hit the save button to copy and that's it!<br><br><br>

But some may wonder: what are those letters with numbers that are used to assemble the shirts?<br>

Those combinations are hexadecimal digits, since that is how computers work to generate RGB colors.<br>

In short, the hexadecimal digits are 16, and they range from<br> 0 to F. If we added 5+5 in decimal form, it would give us 10, but in hexadecimal the result is A (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F).<br>

Knowing that is enough, now it only remains to know how colors are formed<br>. We already know that 0 is the lowest number and F is the highest in the hexadecimal scale, therefore:<br>
> '#000000' represents the color black<br>
> '#FFFFFF' represents the color white<br>

Thanks to this, different combinations can be assembled, such as:<br>

> '#FF0000': red color<br>
> '#FFFF00': yellow color<br>

And they will say, why did the red one decide to be '#FF0000'?<br>

Well, that happens because in the RGB scale (Red, Green, Blue) (Mixing colors to generate them) it would be (255,0,0) and<br> 255 being the highest number would be equivalent to FF, the same happens for the number lower.</h4><br><br>

<h3>Create maps</h3>
<h4>Perhaps you have ever tried to edit a map and when you opened it<br> you were surprised to not understand what you were seeing, or you<br> played one and thought: how could they have done this?<br>

Well, with this guide you will understand how they work and how to<br> create one from scratch.<br>

Link to editor:<a href="https://haxball.github.io/haxpuck/hbedit/"><u>https://haxball.github.io/haxpuck/hbedit/</a></u><br><br>
1: Name of the stadium, it can be changed in the Text Mode tab.<br>
2: It is all the code with which the stadium is generated, the Haxpuck tool is to make it more intuitive.<br>
3: Map properties to change the stadium, the physics of the ball and the players.<br>
4: They are the properties of the tools that are on the lower right corner, each one has its particularity.<br>
5: Editing tools, such as Undo, Delete, among others.<br>
6: Never touch it, you will never use it<br>
7: Select map objects.<br>
8: It is used to rotate the objects, you will probably use it little, only to clone and rotate.<br>
9: This is the same thing, it is to enlarge the map, but it is given very little use.<br>
10: The most important thing, with this the map is drawn, later we will see the properties in detail.<br>
11: They are the vertices (ends) of the segment, a segment is a line with two vertices.<br>
12: With the pucks you can do many things, balls, corners, posts, whatever happens.<br>
13: It is the goal line, with it the goal is validated, it must be configured for which team.<br>
14: Of the most important since they are the general extremes: Edge of players and edge of the ball.<br><br><br>

 

> 'General: Settings in total.'<br>
     - Spawn Distance: How far from the center do players spawn.<br>
     - Width and Height: Width and length.<br>
> 'Background: The ground.'<br>
     - Type: It is to determine the type of ground, Hockey or Grass.<br>
     - Width and Height: Up to where the floor will be painted.<br>
     - Corner radius: The border size of the corners.<br>
     - Kick-Off radius: Size of the center of the stadium.<br>
> 'Player Physics:'<br>
     - Bounce: Bounce.<br>
     - Inverse Mass: The weight.<br>
     - Damping: It would be like damping.<br>
     - Acceleration: The speed of the player.<br>
     - Kicking Acceleration: The speed of the shot.<br>
     - Kicking Damping: Hehe shot damping(?<br>
     - Kick Strength: The most important, the force when you kick.<br>
> ' Ball Physics:'<br>
     - It has the same configuration, only it changes:<br>
     - Collision mask: what the ball is going to collide with.<br><br><br><br>


- 'bCoef:' The bounce it will have, is generally left by default.<br>
- 'cMask:' The collision to have: red | blue.<br>
- 'cGroup:' I'm not sure how to use it, but I don't remember using it.<br>
- 'trait:' The traits are like general characteristics that can be assigned,<br> for example I create the "line" trait, with a certain<br> cMask, cGroup, color, and that will be assigned to the segment.<br>
- 'curve:' The curve.<br>
- 'vis:' Is if the segment is going to be shown, it has two values: True or False (V or F).<br>
- 'color:' It is to change the color of the segment in hexadecimal, as explained in the tutorial<br> of creating t-shirts.<br><br><br>

A map consists of a graph of coordinates (X,Y)<br>, this is seen in mathematics and is called an ordered pair, basically it would be a point in a certain place.<br>

The only thing they need to know about the ordered pair is that X<br> is the horizontal axis and Y is the vertical axis, only that they have to modify.<br>

Why do I say this?<br>

Since if they need two objects to be at the same height they will have to place the same<br> y, or the same x in case they need to make a post for example.<br><br><br>

Map borders<br>

For the players we will place an external plane so that they cannot leave the dimensions of the map<br>
For the ball we will add an internal plane with cMask ball so that the ball bounces<br> and a bCoef of 1 so that it has an impulse<br>

To make the borders of the map (in the classic style) it is very simple,<br> we are only going to make invisible segments that surround the line that borders the stadium.<br>

Finally we are going to learn how to name it and download it to play.<br>

Name: Text mode tab we are going to write the name between the quotes.<br><br><br>

Download it: They select all the code with Select All, <br>copy and paste it into a Notepad, then save it as .hbs and it is generated.<br>

Remember that with the following link you will have access to the names of all the variables:<br>

  Link: <a href=" https://github.com/haxball/haxball-issues/wiki/Stadium-(.hbs)-File"><u> https://github.com/haxball/haxball-issues/wiki/Stadium-(.hbs)-File</a></u><br>

Once you know all this, I think it's time to put it into practice and start testing it to learn much more.<br>

  The best advice is to download maps and try it to see how things can be done<br>
  , at <a href=" https://haxmaps.com/ "><u> https://haxmaps.com/ </a></u> you will find thousands to analyze them,<br> the one you are curious about can download it,<br> copy all the code and paste it in the Text Mode tab for it to be generated.

<h3>Positions</h3>
<h4>To maintain the order and level of the room, it is essential that the players respect the following positions:<br><br>
🥊 | Archer (GK)<br>
It plays a fundamental role in the game since it is responsible<br> for avoiding goals. He must play calm, be attentive to the goal and<br> always go out with a safe pass to the SIDES or the MC.<br><br>
🤚 | Laterals (RS/RL)<br>
They are DEFENDERS. They must prioritize the defensive order and<br> the clean exit of the ball. They can go up to support the attack<br> from the side in situations that warrant it, but their main function is<br> DEFENSIVE and they should not be neglected.<br><br>
🧠 | Midfielder (CM)<br>
He is the most important player on the team. He plays centralized.<br> He has both branding and offensive duties.<br>
He rarely opens up to the sides, just to cover a LATERAL that was<br> left ahead, or in particular situations.<br>
He should be offered as a passing option in the center both on the<br> way out and in offensive situations, waiting outside the box to<br> redistribute the ball.<br>
He will be in charge of marking the rival MC to prevent him from<br> playing comfortably.<br>
Do not claim this position if you are not sure how to fill it.<br><br>
👟 | Extremes (ED/EI)<br>
In addition to attacking they must defend.<br> They are always wide open for their respective band.<br>
They have to prevent the ball from going past them by closing the<br> line.<br>
In defensive situations, they go down to support their BACK by<br> marking to prevent him from being outnumbered, and then<br> offering themselves as an outlet on the wing.<br>
In attack they will be in charge of the corners and must prioritize<br> the center to the area for the FRONT to define.<br><br>
⚽ | Forward Center (DC)<br>
His task is to put pressure on the opponent's exit (along with the<br> ENDERS) and define goal situations.<br>
He must wait for the centers in the area, and will only go to dispute<br> the corner if the EXTREMIST has not yet arrived.<br><br></h4> <img src="https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/AI0CgXUUvRAJaFgwcoJ9XOd4SgLSX1BHjCbLSsazo_E/https/i.ibb.co/3yrFdB1/Posiciones-Futsal-x7.png"/ width="1000px"><br><br><br><br>

<h3>Extrapolation</h3>
<h4>You may have heard the word extrapolation. Well, today you are going to learn what it is.<br>

The command is: /extrapolation (milliseconds) (-200 to 200)<br>

This is often used if the game is slow to recognize keyboard movement.<br> Maybe you've ever tried it, but if you haven't yet, by<br> doing so you'll notice that everything will be more stuck and this happens because of the following:<br>

Extrapolation is an estimate of what could happen, so when we<br> estimate a certain number of milliseconds we are telling the <br> game to predict based on calculations where everything (players, ball, etc.) will be in the given milliseconds.<br>

Therefore, this will help in a certain way so that you have more<br> control when moving.<br>

So now that you know how it works, use it with caution because<br> once you upload it you will never see the Haxball in the same way again.<br></h4>

                    All Hacks are viruses!<br>
All hacks, especially, HaxBall hacks are made for one reason: To steal money from you.<br>

It can look nice and friendly, but the true is: when you download a hack, you also download a viruse that you can't see.That virus steals your information and then, money.<br>
I won't put any hacks in this page, because i'm good guy. But if you are stupid, you can try to google them.

Moreover,

Every cheaters are offten banned from the rooms. So, don't crash your reputation!<br>

                    The first and foremost thing to do when you are going to play Haxball is to turn off all other unnecessary programs (especially the ones that use your internet connections).
Sometimes delays aren't caused by your computer, but by other people in your household. If you watch YouTube, Netflix, download or stream online, you may have a hard time playing the game, because they use up your entire internet connection.
A wireless connection is generally not a good way to play Haxball as it has the potential to be unstable. Try to have a more stable connection by using a wired connection, for example. If you use a wireless connection, be sure to disconnect all devices from Wi-Fi to ensure you get the lowest ping.
If you have a very cheap modem/router with your Internet connection, you might consider replacing it. This could be the cause of some lag issues.
Haxball may seem like a simple browser game, but it eats up your computer's hardware. Make sure your graphics card driver is updated to the latest version. If you're still having a hard time playing, maybe try the game without hardware acceleration. Changing fps from 60 to 30 can also help sometimes.
We can then check the load on your Internet connection. Press "windows flag" + "r" and type "cmd". A black screen will appear. Type "netstat". There you will see all the connections. If you have more than 15/20 established connections, it is very possible that you have some spyware or other type of virus and your computer needs to be cleaned.
Another way to reduce the connection problem is to release and renew the connection. Once again, press "windows flag" + "r" and type "cmd". Type "ipconfig /release" (this will turn your connection off) and then type "ipconfig /renew" (turns it back on). Also go ahead and type "ipconfig /flushdns" to flush your DNS cache. <a href="https://spacesports.freeforums.net/thread/706/reduce-lag-on-haxball">  Original Article</a>
